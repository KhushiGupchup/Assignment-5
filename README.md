I created a reusable useFetch hook to simplify data fetching across components, making it easy to retrieve data from any API endpoint. The hook efficiently manages loading and error states, providing a better user experience by clearly indicating when data is being fetched or if an error occurs. I used useCallback to ensure a stable reference for the fetch function, preventing unnecessary re-renders and improving performance. Additionally, I designed a simple and responsive product display to present the fetched data in an organized and visually appealing manner. Overall, the hook is flexible and can be reused across different components and API endpoints, enhancing the maintainability and scalability of the application.
